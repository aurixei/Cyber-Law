## What is measurement?
It is the empirical, objective assignment of numbers, according to a rule derived from a model or theory, to attributes of objects or events with the intent of describing them. Or quantitatively expressed reduction of uncertainty based on one or more observations.

# Agile Principles and Scrum Framework (SIMULATION)

Roles in Scrum Team:
- Product owner
- Scrum master
- Development team members

Developing a basic prototype within the session going through key scrum events and processes:

### Sprint Planning (15 Minutes)
- Product owner creates a backlog(to-do list ordered by priority) OR user stories (The "As `blablabla`, I wish to `blablabla`, so that `blablabla`)
- Team uses estimation techniques to estimate effort on each story
- Product Owner prioritizes the backlog based on value and feasibility within the time constraints
- Defining Sprint Goal; Delivering the core functionality of the app. Team selects stories from backlogs that they aim to complete within the sprint (15 Minutes)
### Daily Stand-Up (5 Minutes)
Improving transparency and adapt quickly to changes or blockers.
- Discuss: **What they did yesterday, What they plan to do today, Any issues they are facing that hinders progress (blockers)?** for each team member
- Scrum master ensures time constraint of meeting and encourages focus and motivation. (moral support guy)
### Sprint Execution and Collaboration (30 Minutes)
- Teams work together to develop or simulate the assigned user stories using mockups.
- During sprint, add a change when new features or blockers happen. Team should adjust accordingly
- Scrum master helps resolve communication issues and guides the team through following the progress changes.
### Sprint Review (10 Minutes)
- Presentation of the features they developed
- Ask for feedback from classmates acting as mock stakeholders
- Adjust based on input. Product owner may reprioritize the backlogs according to the inputs.
